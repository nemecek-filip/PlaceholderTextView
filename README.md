# `PlaceholderTextView`

### I needed `TextView` that shows placeholder text and did not have a lot of time to polish it. But I think this one works reasonably well and is designed to look like `TextField`. 

I did not want to use `NotificationCenter` or the `UITextViewDelegate` because without further modification you would not be able to use the delegate elsewhere where it could be needed.


Feel free to use however you see fit. Maybe as a simple template for creating proper `TextView` with placeholder...
